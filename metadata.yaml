description: 'After finishing college, Jean Lanni did what many new college graduates
  of his era did: spent some quality time traveling around the universe. But instead
  of the typical souvenirs like t-shirts or shot glasses, he brought back a remarkable
  creature as a souvenir of his intergalactic wanderings. In this delightful short
  story, Droozle tires of being a novelty and begins to speak his mind.'
